# FastAPI (LIVE) vs Node.js Backend — Full Route, Functional & Live-Usage Audit

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Scope:** A complete, source-verified comparison of the LIVE production FastAPI backend (copied into `[LIVE] HRMS_COMPLETE/LMS-Backend` and `[LIVE] HRMS_COMPLETE/LMS-Face-Backend`) against the in-progress Node.js port (`Node-LMS-Backend`), plus a live-usage audit of every endpoint against the LIVE frontend (`[LIVE] HRMS_COMPLETE/LMS-Web`).

This document **supersedes** the previous `route_gap_analysis.md` in this repo — several of its claims (upload_router.py existing, LEAVE_APPLICATION_APPLY table, profile field-count mismatch) are stale/incorrect against the current source and are corrected below. Where this audit disagrees with the old one, that is called out explicitly.

> **Mobile app note:** The copied `[LIVE] HRMS_COMPLETE` directory contains only `LMS-Backend`, `LMS-Face-Backend`, `LMS-Web`, `docs`, `start_all.bat`. **No mobile app (`LMS_APP`) is present in this copy.** All "live usage" findings below are therefore based on `LMS-Web` (Next.js admin/employee web portal) only. Endpoints that exist purely to serve a mobile client (face auth, app-version-check, manual/face attendance punch) cannot be shown as "used" by this audit even though they may be actively used in production by a mobile app that simply isn't in this repo copy.

## 1. Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total FastAPI endpoints (13 routers + face microservice) | ~160 (155 in LMS-Backend's 13 routers + 5 in the separate LMS-Face-Backend microservice) |
| Fully missing in Node (entire module) | **Payroll (28), Payroll-Entry (18)** = **46 endpoints, ~30% of all FastAPI routes** |
| Individually missing endpoints in otherwise-ported modules | **7** in Recruitment (AI/CV specific routes) |
| Endpoints ported and functionally equivalent | The bulk of `auth`, `attendance`, `location`, `location-tracking`, `documents`, `hr`, `hrms`, `reference`, `app_version` |
| New, real bugs found in *ported* code (not just gaps) | **1** — see §5. (12 out of the 13 previously identified bugs have been completely resolved, leaving only the DOCS_ROOT environment variable issue). |
| Endpoints confirmed actively used by LMS-Web | The large majority of `hrms`, `payroll`, `payroll-entry`, `recruitment`, `reference` calls (once ported) plus core `auth`/`attendance`/`documents`/`location` flows |
| Endpoints confirmed **dead** even in FastAPI/LMS-Web today | All of `face_router` (5), all of `app_version_router` (2, mobile-only), 4/5 `location_tracking_router`, `/auth/lookup/{phone}`, 3 attendance endpoints (face-punch, manual-punch, single-day report), ~12 payroll/recruitment/reference functions that are defined but never called |

**Bottom line:** The Node port is functionally solid for the employee self-service and HR-admin "core HR" surface (auth, attendance, leave, documents, location live-tracking, location-tracking/geofence, employee CRUD, reference data). **Payroll and payroll-entry are 0% ported**, while **Recruitment is partially ported (29/36 endpoints)**. These three modules are the ones most heavily used by the live web app's HR-admin panels. All previously identified critical bugs in auth/attendance/location have been resolved.

---

## 2. How this audit was produced

Four independent deep-dive passes were run against the current source (not the stale prior audit):

1. **Auth / Attendance / Leave / Location / Location-Tracking** — full endpoint inventory + SQL/logic/error-handling diff.
2. **Documents / HR / HRMS / Reference / App-Version / Face** — full endpoint inventory + SQL/logic/error-handling diff, plus the standalone `LMS-Face-Backend` microservice.
3. **Payroll / Payroll-Entry / Recruitment** — full endpoint inventory and confirmation of missing status (grep-verified across all of `Node-LMS-Backend/src`).
4. **LMS-Web live-usage mapping** — every `services/*.ts` function traced to its backend path, then traced forward to every page/component that actually calls it, to distinguish "used in production" from "defined but dead."

FastAPI mount prefixes were confirmed from `LMS-Backend/main.py`'s `app.include_router(...)` calls, not assumed from filenames.

## 3. Full Route Coverage Matrix

| FastAPI Router | Prefix | # Endpoints | Node Coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `app_version_router.py` | `/app` | 2 | 2/2 | ✅ Fully ported, confirmed correct |
| `auth_router.py` | `/auth` | 8 | 8/8 | ✅ Ported (Previous bugs in login and dashboard resolved) |
| `attendance_router.py` | `/auth` | 5 | 5/5 | ✅ Ported (Previous smart-attendance logic regressions resolved) |
| `location_router.py` | `/auth` | 5 | 5/5 | ✅ Ported (Previous authorization bug on report/summary resolved) |
| `location_tracking_router.py` | `/location-tracking` | 5 | 5/5 | ✅ **Fully ported** — includes geofence, tracking settings update, active tracking employees, statistics |
| `document_router.py` | `/documents` | 10 | 10/10 | ⚠️ Ported — see §5 for remaining default root bug |
| `face_router.py` | `/face` | 5 | 5/5 | ✅ **Fully ported** (as identical DB stubs matching the FastAPI implementation) |
| `hr_router.py` | `/hr` | 2 | 2/2 | ✅ Ported (Previous SQL discrepancies resolved) |
| `hrms_router.py` | `/hrms` | 12 | 12/12 | ✅ Fully ported (Duty roster edit functionality restored) |
| `reference_router.py` | `/reference` | 37 | 37/37 | ✅ Fully ported (Interview types functionality restored) |
| `payroll_router.py` | `/payroll` | 28 | **0/28** | ❌ **Completely missing** |
| `payroll_entry_router.py` | `/payroll-entry` | 18 | **0/18** | ❌ **Completely missing** |
| `recruitment_router.py` | `/recruitment` | 36 | **29/36** | ⚠️ **Partially ported** (AI/CV routes pending) |
| `LMS-Face-Backend` (separate microservice) | `/face/*` (own app) | 5 | N/A | Out of scope — never called by `LMS-Backend` either; independent InsightFace/FAISS service |

Corrections to the prior `route_gap_analysis.md`:
- There is **no `upload_router.py`** in the current FastAPI codebase. File uploads live entirely under `document_router.py` and are fully ported.
- `LEAVE_APPLICATION` (not `LEAVE_APPLICATION_APPLY`) is the correct table on **both** sides — the previously-flagged table mismatch does not exist in the current code.
- The `/auth/profile` "9 fields vs 30 fields" concern is stale: FastAPI's `response_model=ProfileResponse` already restricts the live JSON response to the same 9 fields Node returns.

## 4. Completely Missing Modules (0% ported) — full endpoint list

### 4.1 Payroll (`/payroll/*`) — 28 endpoints, **highest business risk**

| Method | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/payroll/pay-register/periods` | Periods for the pay-register report |
| GET | `/payroll/pay-register` | Pay-register report rows |
| GET | `/payroll/financial-years` | List financial years |
| POST | `/payroll/financial-years` | Create financial year (optionally auto-generates periods) |
| PUT | `/payroll/financial-years/{rule_id}` | Update financial year |

| GET | `/payroll/salary/open-period` | Currently open period |
| POST | `/payroll/salary/process` | **Triggers Oracle PL/SQL proc `HR_SALARY_PROCES_PRO`** — commits internally inside the DB; highest-risk endpoint in the whole audit |

### 4.2 Payroll-Entry (`/payroll-entry/*`) — 18 endpoints

| Method | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/payroll-entry/open-periods` | Open periods for data entry |
| GET | `/payroll-entry/recovery-types` | Loan recovery type LOV |
| GET | `/payroll-entry/allowance-types` | Allowance type LOV |

All mutating endpoints here key off the currently **open period** managed by `/payroll/periods/{period}/status` — porting payroll-entry before payroll's period-locking logic risks writes against periods that should be closed.

### 4.3 Recruitment (`/recruitment/*`) — 37 endpoints

Full applicant-tracking system: jobs, AI-based candidate matching/scoring, applications, interviews (with 409 double-booking conflict detection), interview panel pool, notification templates/selections, offers, CV bulk upload (feeds an **external AI screening pipeline** watching a filesystem drop folder), candidate talent pool, and recruitment analytics.

✅ **29/37 endpoints (Standard ATS CRUD) have been successfully ported to Node.js** (`recruitment.routes.js`, `recruitment.controller.js`, `recruitment.service.js`):
- **Jobs:** list, create, get, update
- **Applications:** list, create, get, patch status
- **Interviews:** list, create, patch
- **Interview Panel / Assignments:** panel pool (list, add, deactivate row, deactivate member), app panel options, assignments (create, list)
- **Notification Templates / Selections:** list templates, selections (create, list)
- **Offers:** list, create, update
- **Analytics:** get analytics
- **Candidates (Talent Pool):** list, create, get, update

❌ **8/37 endpoints (AI Pipeline & CV Uploads) are pending:**
These remaining endpoints require interacting with the filesystem and the standalone Python LLM pipeline (`LMS-Backend/AI/` directory). Porting these requires architectural decisions on whether to port the Gemini LLM logic natively to Node.js or spawn/integrate with the existing Python watchdog daemon.

| Method | Path | What it does | How it works | Why it's difficult to port to Node.js |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/recruitment/candidates/upload-cvs` | Bulk uploads up to 20 PDFs to a drop folder. | Resolves the target directory under `EMP_DOCS`, streams file bytes to `RECRUITMENT_CVS/`, and writes a `_scope.json` sidecar. Watched asynchronously by a Python daemon. | Requires configuring `multer` for multipart form-data parsing (bypassing Express JSON). Must safely handle asynchronous concurrent file I/O and mimic exact Python sidecar naming conventions. |
| GET | `/recruitment/candidates/cv-status` | Polling endpoint for the UI to track CV processing state. | Scans the local filesystem's `RECRUITMENT_CVS` drop zone and `CV_Archive` directories to check the physical existence and JSON states of processed CVs. | Requires reimplementing filesystem directory scanning/polling logic in Node.js that perfectly matches the Python watchdog's output schema and file movement lifecycle. |
| POST | `/recruitment/candidates/{candidate_id}/cv` | Single CV replacement for an existing candidate. | Uploads and overwrites the CV in the candidate's profile directory (handling extension mismatches). | Requires `multer` and careful filesystem manipulation to safely delete old files and write new ones without risking path-traversal vulnerabilities. |
| GET | `/recruitment/candidates/{candidate_id}/cv` | Serves the candidate's CV PDF. | Resolves the absolute path against `DOCS_ROOT` and returns a `FileResponse` (inline or attachment). | Express requires safely piping file streams via `res.download` or `res.sendFile`, managing Content-Disposition headers and MIME types correctly. |
| POST | `/recruitment/candidates/{candidate_id}/apply` | Applies a candidate and triggers background AI scoring. | Uses FastAPI's native `BackgroundTasks` to immediately return 200 OK to the client while kicking off a heavy `svc_evaluate_application` LLM call in a separate thread. | **Architectural mismatch:** Express has no native `BackgroundTasks`. Requires either risky "fire-and-forget" promises (`Promise.resolve().then(...)` - lost on crash) or implementing a dedicated worker queue system (like BullMQ/Redis) for reliability. |
| POST | `/recruitment/jobs/{job_id}/match` | Ranks all talent-pool candidates against a job description. | Uses a Python `ThreadPoolExecutor` to concurrently batch-process a shortlist through the Gemini LLM API, mutating the candidate array in-place with scores. | Porting this means completely translating a complex Python AI orchestration script to Node.js, requiring careful `Promise.all` concurrency control, rate-limiting, and deep `@google/genai` SDK integration. |
| GET | `/recruitment/jobs/{job_id}/top-candidates` | Fetches the final AI shortlist and evaluation JSONs. | Queries the DB for applications and parses the stored LLM assessment JSON blobs. | Tightly coupled to the exact JSON output schemas produced by the Python AI pipeline; any variance in Node.js LLM output would break the UI. |
| GET | `/recruitment/applications/{app_id}/evaluation` | Fetches the detailed AI evaluation for a single application. | Queries the DB for the `APP_EVALUATIONS` table containing the LLM-generated JSON breakdown (strengths, weaknesses, scores). | Similar to top-candidates, tightly coupled to the Python AI pipeline's JSON structures. |

**Discrepancies in the 29 Ported Endpoints (1-to-1 Parity Check):**
While functionally solid, a strict 1-to-1 comparison reveals two exact-parity deviations in the Node.js implementation:
1. **Route Prefix Mismatch:** ✅ **[RESOLVED]** The FastAPI endpoint is `GET /applications/{app_id}/interview-panel-options`. Initially ported as `panel-options`, it has now been correctly renamed to `interview-panel-options` in Node.js to ensure 1-to-1 parity.
2. **Company Scoping Fallback Logic:** In FastAPI's `create_job` and `create_candidate`, if an admin provides an invalid company ID (or leaves it blank), the system silently defaults/overwrites it to their first allowed company (`allowed_c[0]`). The Node.js controllers were implemented strictly—returning a `403 Forbidden ("Cannot create job for this company")`. While Node.js is more "secure/strict," it fundamentally breaks 1-to-1 frontend fallback expectations.


**Details & Issues Resolved in Node.js Recruitment Porting:**
During the porting of the Part A Recruitment endpoints, several critical issues were identified and successfully resolved to achieve 1:1 parity with the FastAPI implementation:
1. **`ORA-00942: table or view does not exist` (Notification Selections):** The Node.js port initially attempted to write to a non-existent `RECRUITMENT_` alias. This was fixed by mapping queries and inserts to the correct `APP_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGES` table.
2. **`ORA-01745: invalid host/bind variable name` (Interview Assignments):** The date/time bindings in the SQL query for `APP_INTERVIEW_ASSIGNMENTS` had mismatched parameter counts. The bind parameters and SQL statement were corrected to seamlessly insert interview assignments.
3. **Empty Array on GET Requests:** Endpoints like `listInterviewAssignments` and `listNotificationSelections` originally returned empty responses due to querying the wrong aliases. Fixed by writing raw accurate SELECT statements against the DB.
4. **Incorrect "Added By" Audit Logs (`addPanelMembers`):** The admin tracker was defaulting to `SYSTEM` instead of logging the `admin_card`. Fixed by propagating the `admin_card` query parameter correctly from the controller layer down to the service layer.
5. **CLOB String Extraction Error (`Cannot read properties of undefined reading 'BIND_OUT'`):** Encountered when attempting to extract profile data in `createCandidate`. Fixed by correctly configuring the Oracle DB `fetchInfo: { "FIELD_NAME": { type: oracledb.STRING } }` parameters to handle CLOB mapping in Node.js `oracledb`.
6. **Template Rendering Logic:** The Python `_render` (template placeholder substitution), `_fmtDuration`, and `_messageContext` extraction routines used for dynamic email generation were completely recreated in Node.js, ensuring identical notification messaging.
7. **Scope Alignment:** Repurposed Node's `adminRights.service.js` equivalent scoping (`compc` and `brnch` logic) across the recruitment routes, perfectly mirroring FastAPI's `_resolve_filter_lists` logic.

### 4.4 Location-Tracking (`/location-tracking/*`) — 5 endpoints (✅ **Fully Ported**)

| Method | Path | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/location-tracking/settings/{emp_code}` | GPS tracking toggle + interval | ✅ **Ported** |
| POST | `/location-tracking/settings/{emp_code}/update` | Update toggle/interval | ✅ **Ported** |
| GET | `/location-tracking/geofence/{emp_code}` | `LOCATION_FIXED`, `DEFAULT_LATITUDE`, `DEFAULT_LONGITUDE`, `MARGIN` | ✅ **Ported** |
| GET | `/location-tracking/active-employees` | List employees with tracking on | ✅ **Ported** |
| GET | `/location-tracking/statistics` | Tracking coverage stats | ✅ **Ported** |

✅ **[RESOLVED]** All 5 endpoints have been fully ported to Node (`locationTracking.routes.js`, `locationTracking.controller.js`, `locationTracking.service.js`, `locationTracking.schema.js`) with 1-to-1 exact SQL parity against `HR_EMP_MASTER`. Verified and confirmed operational.

### 4.5 Face Authentication (`/face/*`) — 5 endpoints (✅ **Fully Ported as Stubs**)

| Method | Path | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/face/register` | Save face embeddings during registration | ✅ **Ported (Stub)** |
| POST | `/face/verify` | Match frames against one employee's registered face | ✅ **Ported (Stub)** |
| POST | `/face/identify` | 1:N match against all registered faces | ✅ **Ported (Stub)** |
| GET | `/face/status/{card_no}` | Whether an employee has a registered face | ✅ **Ported** |
| DELETE | `/face/delete/{card_no}` | Soft-delete (`IS_ACTIVE='N'`) | ✅ **Ported** |

✅ **[RESOLVED]** All 5 standalone endpoints from `LMS-Backend`'s `face_router.py` have been implemented 1-to-1 in Node.js (`face.routes.js`). These maintain the exact same stubbed behavior (updating `FACE_REGISTERED` flags without real embedding processing) as the main Python backend, matching its original design.

Separately, the standalone **`LMS-Face-Backend`** microservice (`face_rec/api.py`, InsightFace/FAISS-backed, its own FastAPI app) implements real face matching for its own `/face/register|verify|identify|status|delete` routes on port `8002`. That microservice remains Python-based (due to FAISS/InsightFace dependencies) and continues to serve the real AI functionality out-of-band.

## 5. Bugs & Regressions Found in Code That *IS* Ported (ranked by severity)

These are places where the Node implementation exists but behaved differently from FastAPI. **12 out of 13 bugs have now been explicitly resolved.**

### 🔴 Critical

**1. `GET /auth/location/report/summary` — HR-admin company/branch scoping not enforced**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Fixed by wrapping queries with `resolveFilterLists(admin_card_no, compc, brnch)` in `getLocationReportSummary`.

**2. Smart attendance (`POST /auth/attendance/{card_no}`, `/auth/attendance/face`) — two logic gaps corrupt attendance data**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Both gaps (the overnight-shift missing closure and the 60-minute double-tap guard) were ported into Node's `attendance.service.js`.

### 🟠 High

**3. `POST /auth/login` — no force-update (426) guard**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Node's `login` controller now calls `forceUpdateBlock` to block outdated clients.

**4. `documents.controller.js` — two request-handling bugs**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Fixed missing `next` param inside `uploadDocument` and added error handling for DB errors inside `listEmployeeDocuments` to prevent hanging.

**5. `documents.service.js` — wrong storage root default**
⚠️ **[UNRESOLVED]** (Explicitly skipped per request). `DOCS_ROOT` defaults to `E:\...\Node-LMS-Backend\EMP_PHOTOS`; FastAPI defaults to `C:\Erp_Systems\HRMS_LMS_APP\EMP_DOCS` — different drive, different folder name. Unless `EMP_DOCS_ROOT` is explicitly set to match production in Node's environment, files written by one backend won't be found by the other during any phased cutover.

**6. `documents.service.js` — `empcodeForCard` joins on a nonexistent column**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** The incorrect join on `e.EMP_NO = h.EMPCODE` was corrected to match FastAPI's equivalent join (`e.EMPCODE = h.EMPCODE`).

### 🟡 Medium

**7. `GET /hr/employees/search` — wrong face-status source + row-duplication risk**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Fixed to use `EMPLOYEE.FACE_REGISTERED` flag properly instead of `LEFT JOIN` duplicates.

**8. `GET /hrms/employees/{empcode}/card` — missing company scope on designation lookup**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added the missing company scope filtering (`AND TO_CHAR(dg.COMPC)=TO_CHAR(m.UNIT_ID)`) on designation lookup.

**9. `GET /auth/dashboard/{card_no}` — different source columns than FastAPI**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Corrected raw codes for department (`h.DEPT_NO`) and designation (`h.DESG_CD`) rather than resolved names, and fixed HOD reporting to be aligned with FastAPI.

**10. `GET /auth/profile/{card_no}` — department/designation join lacks FastAPI's zero-padding fuzzy match**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added `LTRIM(..., '0')` around fields in equi-joins to prevent silent failures.

**11. Error-response envelope is inconsistent across the Node codebase**
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Refactored to standardize around `{"detail": "..."}` as FastAPI does, ensuring 400s and 403s shape match client expectations uniformly.

### 🟢 Low / Notes

**12.** `changePasswordSchema` requires `new_password.length >= 8`; FastAPI has no such constraint.
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Adjusted to align exactly with FastAPI's logic.

**13.** `GET /auth/location/report/summary` (same endpoint as bug #1) additionally only supports single-value equality filters for dept/designation and drops multi-value `IN (...)` support.
✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added correct support for `IN (...)` filters and fixed designation lookup scoping mismatch.

---

## 6. Individually Missing Endpoints in Otherwise-Ported Modules

✅ **[RESOLVED]** All listed endpoints were successfully implemented in Node exactly identically to FastAPI's behaviors.

| Endpoint | Module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PUT /hrms/duty-roster/entry/{pk}` | hrms | ✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added `updateDutyRosterEntry` controller/service/schema for complete ERP-owned write. |
| `GET /reference/interview-types` | reference | ✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added list logic with proper scope filtering matching FastAPI. |
| `POST /reference/interview-types` | reference | ✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added add logic for creating company-scoped interview types. |
| `DELETE /reference/interview-types/{type_id}` | reference | ✅ **[RESOLVED]** Added soft-delete logic protecting global seed records, directly equivalent to FastAPI. |

---

## 7. Live Usage: What LMS-Web Actually Calls

Frontend (`LMS-Web`) talks to the FastAPI backend at `BACKEND_URL=http://163.61.91.221:8001` via a Next.js rewrite (`/api/:path*` → backend), through `services/api.ts`'s `apiRequest()`. No hardcoded URLs or path typos were found — every call maps to a real FastAPI route.

### 7.1 Usage summary by router

| Router | Endpoints used by LMS-Web | Endpoints never called by LMS-Web |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_router.py` | login, dashboard, leave-balances, apply-leave, leave-status, profile, change-password (7/8) | `GET /auth/lookup/{phone}` — no service wrapper at all |
| `attendance_router.py` | summary, report-range (2/5) | face-punch, manual-punch, single-day report — mobile/kiosk-only or dead |
| `document_router.py` | 9/10 (all except company-logo GET, which likely renders inline — not fully confirmed) | — |
| `face_router.py` | **0/5** | Entire module unreachable from web — no `faceService.ts` exists at all |
| `hr_router.py` | employees/search (1/2) | `POST /hr/face/enroll` — unreachable from web |
| `hrms_router.py` | **12/12** | — fully used |
| `location_router.py` | summary, history, report/trail, report/summary (4/5, via direct `apiRequest` calls for the first two, bypassing a typed service wrapper) | `POST /auth/location/batch` — code exists client-side (`locationTracker.ts`) but that module is **never imported anywhere**, so it never fires in practice |
| `location_tracking_router.py` | settings/update only (1/5) | settings-read, geofence, active-employees, statistics — all unused by web (would be mobile-only if implemented) |
| `payroll_router.py` | 26/28 | `PUT /payroll/financial-years/{rule_id}`, `POST /payroll/periods` — service functions exist but are never invoked from any UI |
| `payroll_entry_router.py` | **18/18** | — fully used |
| `recruitment_router.py` | 27/36 | `GET /jobs/{id}`, `POST /jobs/{id}/match`, `GET /applications/{id}`, `GET /applications/{id}/evaluation`, `POST /interviews` (superseded by interview-assignments), `DELETE /panel-pool/{id}` (superseded by the scope-aware deactivate), `GET .../interview-assignments`, `GET .../notification-selections` |
| `reference_router.py` | 32/37 | `POST /reference/grades`, `POST /reference/cadre` (imported but never called), `POST /reference/units` |
| `app_version_router.py` | **0/2** | Mobile-only, no web use case |

### 7.2 Notable live-usage findings

- **`locationTracker.ts` (the GPS background-capture poller) is dead code** — it is never imported anywhere in the app. `POST /auth/location/batch` is fully implemented client-side (buffering, retry, flush) but never actually fires from the live web app.
- **`face_router` and `app_version_router` are 100% unreachable from LMS-Web** — consistent with being mobile-app-only surfaces. Since no mobile app is present in this repo copy, this audit cannot confirm real-world usage of those 7 endpoints either way — only that the web client never touches them.
- **`hrms_router` and `payroll_entry_router` are the two modules used at 100%** by the live web app — meaning porting payroll-entry to Node (once payroll's period-locking exists) would immediately restore full HR-admin functionality parity for that module.
- `/reference/locations` and `/auth/location/summary`/`/history` are called through **both** the typed service layer **and** raw inline `apiRequest()` calls in `LocationPanel.tsx` — duplicate client logic hitting the same valid endpoints (not a bug, but a maintenance risk).
- Roughly a dozen service functions across payroll/recruitment/reference are defined and even imported in some cases, but never actually invoked by any button/handler — see the detailed list in the agent transcript if a full dead-code cleanup pass is wanted (`updateFinancialYear`, `createPeriod`, `createInterview`, `deactivatePanelPoolRow`, `listInterviewAssignments`, `listNotificationSelections`, `addGrade`, `addUnit`, `addCadre`, `fetchAttendanceReport`, plus the recruitment matching trigger and a few single-record GETs).

## 8. Prioritized Recommendations

~~1. **Fix the location-report-summary authorization bug (§5.1) immediately** — it's a live data-exposure issue in currently-deployed Node code, not a missing feature, and requires only mirroring the fix already present two functions away in the same file.~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~2. **Fix the smart-attendance overnight/double-tap regressions (§5.2)** before Node attendance handles any real night-shift traffic — this is silently corrupting attendance records today for any night-shift employee routed through Node.~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~3. **Add the login force-update guard (§5.3)** — one function call, already implemented and used correctly elsewhere.~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~4. **Fix the two `documents.controller.js` bugs (§5.4)** — both are unhandled-error paths that hang or crash requests; trivial fixes (add `next`, call it).~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~5. **Normalize error-response shape to `{detail}` everywhere (§5.11)** — mechanical but wide-reaching; do this before shipping any new module so new code doesn't perpetuate three different conventions.~~ ✅ **DONE**

**Remaining Recommendations:**

6. **Port `payroll_entry_router.py` (18 endpoints) next** — it is used at 100% by the live web app, and every endpoint is comparatively low-risk CRUD *once* the period-locking state from `payroll_router.py` exists to gate it correctly.
7. **Port the period/financial-year-locking subset of `payroll_router.py`** as a prerequisite for #6 (it's the gating mechanism, and the salary-processing endpoint is separable and can be deferred).
8. **Defer `POST /payroll/salary/process`, the recruitment AI-matching/CV pipeline, and the recruitment background-task-based `apply` endpoint** — these depend on external systems (PL/SQL stored proc with internal commit; LLM evaluator; filesystem CV watcher) and need an architecture decision (how does Express replace FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`?) before porting, not just translation.
~~9. **Port `location-tracking` geofence + settings endpoints** if any mobile client is actually live against the Node backend — this is a safety-relevant gap, not a nice-to-have, if mobile attendance geofencing is meant to work through Node.~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~10. **Decide the fate of standalone `/face/*`** — either implement the 4 missing service functions (`verifyFace`, `identifyFace`, `deleteFace`, list-all-registered) on top of the existing `face.service.js` foundation, or confirm the mobile app will keep using `LMS-Face-Backend` directly and treat this as intentionally out of scope.~~ ✅ **DONE**
~~11. Low-priority SQL correctness fixes (§5.7–5.10) can be batched together since they're all "add a missing COMPC scope / LTRIM / correct join column" style one-liners.~~ ✅ **DONE**
